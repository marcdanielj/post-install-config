<p>
After installing osTicket and logging in with admin credentials, youâ€™ll land on the Admin Panel. To set up roles, go to Agents -> Roles. Rename an existing role or click "Add New Role" to create one. I renamed an "All Access" role to "Supreme Admin" with full permissions. For departments and teams, click their tabs (Agents -> Departments or Teams) and configure as needed - e.g., a "SysAdmins" department and an "Online Banking" team.

</p>
<p>
To let anyone submit tickets without registering, go to Admin Panel -> Settings -> Users -> uncheck "Require registration and login to create tickets". For stricter control, check it and require login instead.

</p>
<p>
To add agents (workers), go to Admin Panel -> Agents -> Add New. Create an agent like "Jane" under the Account tab, then set her department (e.g., SysAdmins), access, and teams in their respective tabs.

</p>
<p>
To add users (customers), switch to the Agent Panel by clicking it in the top-right corner. Then go to Users -> Add New, fill in details for someone like "Karen", and save.
</p>

</p>
<p>
For Service Level Agreements (SLAs), return to the Admin Panel -> Manage -> SLA -> Add New SLA Plan. Set up one like "Sev-A" with a 1-hour grace period and 24/7 schedule, then click "Add Plan". Repeat for others like "Sev-B" (4 hours, 24/7) or "Sev-C" (8 hours, business hours).

</p>
<p>
Finally, set up Help Topics to categorize tickets. Go to Admin Panel -> Manage -> Help Topics -> Add New Help Topic. Add options like "Business Critical Outage", "Personal Computer Issues", or "Password Reset", setting their priority and department as needed.
